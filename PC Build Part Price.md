# PC Build Part Price

Make a program that calculate the price for a user's desired PC build.  

The program will ask the use to enter the parts name from a predefined menu. The program will also calculate if some selected part is available or not(like graphics card)[the std::time could be used to show an interface like "checking..." to delay the time].  

Use reusable functions & enums in this program. Lastly, show 2 separate price - one with monitor, one without monitor. 

# Sample Output

c. Intel core i7 10700  
d. Intel core i9 10900  
 [Types d]
